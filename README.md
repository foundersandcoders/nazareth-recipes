An open source, collaborative collection of the communal recipes cooked within the Founders & Coders community. The idea started from the high volume of demands for the recipes of meals cooked at the Nazareth Guesthouse (hence the name!) but has grown to become more than that - we want it to be a place where people from the entire communtiy can add, view, and, most importantly, follow any recipe they wish.
