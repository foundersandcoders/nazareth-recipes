## Ingredients

A wok, vegetable oil (olive oil x), 1/2 of a large white cabbage, 3 pieces of 50g of slim Scallion (Green onion), 2 pieces of large dried chili pepper, a base sauce, 5 or more cloves of garlic.

* Base sauce needs to be prepared boiled with following ingredients
  * 4:5:1 ratio of Soy sauce, Oyster sauce and sugar.
  * 5:5 ratio of Soy sauce and sugar for veggie friends.

The bottom line of the dish is _timing_. It is essential to have all ingredients chopped and ready.

### Ingredient preparation

* Slice cabbage for width of 1cm or less
* Chop green onions for width of less than 1cm
* Chop chili pepper large enough so that people don't eat it accidentally
* Slice garlic

### Preparation

1. Heat the wok and add enough vegetable oil. This is stir-fry dish. Make sure to be generous with oil

2. Once the wok is hot enough (on medium low), add green onions and wait until the oil starts to smell green onion-y. This is to add a primary flavor to oil. (For 3-4 min)

3. Add red chili pepper and stir. This is to add secondary flavor to oil (3min)

4. Add garlic and wait a min or two

5. Add sliced cabbage and stir constantly to prevent it from being burnt

6. Add base sauce based on members' preference

7. Once the cabbage is half cooked, give it max fire on stove and stir it until done.
   _This step is important because if cabbage stays on medium low until fully cooked, it gets too mushy and loses it's favor of stir-fry dish._

### Optional

Stir-Fry Cabbage goes well with any type of rice or noodle. Also, most oyster sauce sold in Nazareth (i.e one from brand 'Taste of Asia' ) actually does not contain **oyster** so it is just flavor to mimic oyster sauce. I highly recommend adding oyster sauce when making base sauce therefore.
