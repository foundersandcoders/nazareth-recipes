### Ingredients
- 2 small eggs
- a handful of parsley
- a handful of green/spring onions
- 1 teaspoon zaatar ( or to taste )
- salt and pepper

### Preparation

1. Chop the parsley and the green/spring onions into small pieces.
2. Add everything into a small bowl and whisk it with a *fork*.
3. Heat up a pan with a bit olive oil and wait for 1 min untill it heats up.
4. Add all of the mix into the heated pan.
5. From here it's self preference on how much you want the Omelette to be cooked, I would say flip it when gets golden-brown.

Tips:
- The more you stir it the fluffier the Omelette is going to get.
- These are the base ingredients you could always get creative and add new ingredients on top of the base.
- Don't screw up the flip.
