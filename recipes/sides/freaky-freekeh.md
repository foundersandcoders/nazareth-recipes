## Ingredients
- 3 mugs of freekeh
- oil
- 1 large onion, grated
- nutmeg
- cardamom (preferably the spice, not the seeds)
- salt
- pepper
- vegetarian chicken stock cube
- flaked almonds, and/or other nuts of your choice

## Method
- cover the freekeh with water a leave for a couple of minutes until it absorbs the water
- Heat some oil in a sauce pan, then add the grated onion, cardamom, nutmeg, salt, pepper and the stock, and leave for 2 minutes. **Suha's Special Tip:** You decide how much of each spice to use, but be generous with the cardamom ;) 
- Add the freekeh, and cover with 3 mugs-worth of boiling water. Simmer gently, adding more water if necessary, tasting it regularly until it is ready. **Suha's Special Tip:** Be careful not to add too much water!
- Fry or roast the flaked almonds, and serve them sprinkled on top of the freekeh.
