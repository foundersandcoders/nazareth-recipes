# Ingredients
- A load of courgettes (10ish small ones)
- 4 Cloves of garlic
- 3 Onions
- Zest of 2 limes
- A couple of tablespoons of flour (preferably self-raising, or else plain white)
- 3 eggs
- A load of white arabic cheese (like halloumi, 3/4 slabs?)
- Coriander seeds, ground
- Chilli Powder
- Cumin seeds, ground

## Preparation

1. Grate or finely slice the courgettes, and place in a mixing bowl with some salt to draw out the water.
2. Finely dice the onions and garlic, add to drained courgettes (squeeze them to get as much water out as possible).
3. Add beaten eggs and flour, as much flour as you need until you get quite a thick batter.
4. Add spices and seasoning, to taste.
5. Dice cheese into 1cm cubes, add as much or as little as you like.
6. Heat a fair amount of oil in a pan (2cm deep) to smoking point, add big spoonful of batter mix, fry until golden brown and flip (4-5 minutes on each side).
7. Keep warm in oven whilst cooking all of the mix.
