### Ingredients
* 3 table spoon olive oil
* 1 cup onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup cracked green wheat (freekeh), thoroughly washed 3 times
* 1 cube vegetable or chicken stock
* Salt to taste
* 1 tea spoon cumin

### Directions
In a pot over medium heat, saute the chopped onions with olive oil until lightly browned. Add freekeh and stir with onions for a minute or two (roasting freekeh before cooking gives them a richer flavor). Add vegetable stock and 6 cups of water . Cover the pot and leave it under low-medium heat for about an hour or until freekeh is very tender.
Now after having them cooked, add cumin and salt to taste.  Serve hot with green olives and your preference of bread.

##### Notice: Freekeh soup in particular is great for those cold winter days. Itâ€™s filling and tasteful, yet light and easy to prepare.
